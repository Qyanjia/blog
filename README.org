* About
  This is my personal blog, and its also my first Rust project.
** Why Rust
   Well, I know there are a lot of alternatives to writing a blog, but I find
   other languages such as Java, Python, Javascript,Php, are not fancy enough
   ;-) Kidding, the truth is that I have learned Rust for more that a half
   years, but I still could not build real some stuff on Rust. Yes, I lack of
   idea or I not am skillful enough to fulfill my thought. Finally, I decided to
   rewrite my [[https://samrayleung.github.io][blog]] which was built on Github Page and Org-mode.
* Getting Started
** Requirement
*** Rust
    Install Rust via shell script
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
    #+END_SRC
    After installing, you might need to 
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      source $HOME/.cargo/bin
    #+END_SRC
    Because this project is built on Rocket, and Rocket depends on Rust nightly,
    so you need change Rust environment to nightly
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      rustup default nightly
    #+END_SRC
*** Diesel Cli
    This project use Diesel as Orm framework, so you need to install its command
    line tool via Rust package manager(eg, Cargo)
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres
    #+END_SRC
*** Postgresql
    you need to install [[https://www.postgresql.org/][Postgresql database]], and then configure postgresql by
    following document's guide
*** Init database
    After everything is done, it is time to create table in database for this project, just run
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      diesel migration run
    #+END_SRC
** Launch Rocket
   Everything is ok, now, launch Rocket:
   #+BEGIN_SRC 
    cargo run
   #+END_SRC
   And open your favourite browser, enter ~localhost:8000~
